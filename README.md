## Summary 
I have commited to a 66 days of data challange which was initiated by <a href="https://www.twitter.com/KenJee_DS/"> Ken Jee</a> a Data Scientiest and a Youtuber, Daily I will be updating the details of the things I have learned, books I have read, courses I have completed & the projects which I will be doing in the course of 66 days. 

This is a better way to be accountable to the data journey and it will also help me build a daily coding and learning habit. 

## Books
(To be read....)

## Courses
1. SQL by <a href="https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/"> Mode Analytics</a> 
2. NoSQL by Coursera -  <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-mongodb?="> Introduction to MongoDB</a> 

## My Journey of 66 Days of Data 

### Day 1
* **SQL** - **Structured Query Language** is a database language, used to update databases, execute queries, highly organized and structured approach to information management. It was designed for relational database management systems. SQL has a variety of functions that allow its users to read, manipulate, and change data but over much larger datasets and on multiple tables at the same time.
* Today I learnt SQL from the start from <a href="https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/"> Mode Analytics</a>, a very great tutorial for someone who wants to brushup their skills. I worked on Use cases in figuring out why was there an drop in engagement from the user end, had to improve a search functionality for a teams next develping cycle and also had to validate the A/B test for the existing products to improve it's user experince. 

### Day 2 
* I started with the NoSQL database MongoDB from Coursera - <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-mongodb?="> Introduction to MongoDB</a>, a great course to learn and understand the concepts.
* **NoSQL** - is based on non-relational database management systems. This contains large amounts of unstructured data, such as text from emails, customer surveys, or the data collected by websites and all this information are in the form of unorganized data. So to store these kinds of data we use a NoSQL database system.

**Advantages**
* Can handle large amounts of data.
* Different types of data can be stored and no limit to storing it.
* Scaling is easy

### Day 3
* Today I completed the Coursera course from MongoDB, worked on some use cases and problems. 


### Day 4
* I worked on few problems from Leetcode and practice a lot of problems. 
* I also started writing a Blog post about what I have lerned. I am beginner in content or technical writing so might take some time to come up with the post. I have also decided to write Blog post for every week starting from this week until the end of 66 days of data challange. This will keep me accountable and motivated to come up with different topics to write a Blog. The Blog will be SQL Vs NoSQL their Advantages and Applications and I will be posting this to my Medium account.

### Day 5
* Today again I solved few problems from Leetcode and also on Hackerrank. 
* Blog is halfway through the point now, I know it is talking some time, but this is the 1st time I will be writing so many words and explaining it in simple terms. Let's see how this pans out.
