I have commited to a 66 days of data challange which was initiated by <a href="https://www.twitter.com/KenJee_DS/"> Ken Jee</a> a Data Scientiest and a Youtuber, Daily I will be updating the details of the things I have learned, books I have read, courses I have completed & the projects which I will be doing in the course of 66 days. 

This is a better way to be accountable to the data journey and it will also help me build a daily coding and learning habit.

## My Journey of 66 Days of Data 

### Day 1
* **SQL** - **Structured Query Language** is a database language, used to update databases, execute queries, highly organized and structured approach to information management. It was designed for relational database management systems. SQL has a variety of functions that allow its users to read, manipulate, and change data but over much larger datasets and on multiple tables at the same time.
* Today I learnt SQL from the start from <a href="https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/"> Mode Analytics</a>, a very great tutorial for someone who wants to brushup their skills. I worked on Use cases in figuring out why was there an drop in engagement from the user end, had to improve a search functionality for a teams next develping cycle and also had to validate the A/B test for the existing products to improve it's user experince.
