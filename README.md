## Summary 
I have commited to a 66 days of data challange which was initiated by <a href="https://www.twitter.com/KenJee_DS/"> Ken Jee</a> a Data Scientiest and a Youtuber, Daily I will be updating the details of the things I have learned, books I have read, courses I have completed & the projects which I will be doing in the course of 66 days. 

This is a better way to be accountable to the data journey and it will also help me build a daily coding and learning habit.

## My Journey of 66 Days of Data 

### Day 1
* **SQL** - **Structured Query Language** is a database language, used to update databases, execute queries, highly organized and structured approach to information management. It was designed for relational database management systems. SQL has a variety of functions that allow its users to read, manipulate, and change data but over much larger datasets and on multiple tables at the same time.
* Today I learnt SQL from the start from <a href="https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/"> Mode Analytics</a>, a very great tutorial for someone who wants to brushup their skills. I worked on Use cases in figuring out why was there an drop in engagement from the user end, had to improve a search functionality for a teams next develping cycle and also had to validate the A/B test for the existing products to improve it's user experince. 

### Day 2 
* I started with the NoSQL database MongoDB from Coursera - <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-mongodb?="> Introduction to MongoDB</a>, a great course to learn and understand the concepts.
* **NoSQL** - is based on non-relational database management systems. This contains large amounts of unstructured data, such as text from emails, customer surveys, or the data collected by websites and all this information are in the form of unorganized data. So to store these kinds of data we use a NoSQL database system.

**Advantages**
* Can handle large amounts of data.
* Different types of data can be stored and no limit to storing it.
* Scaling is easy

### Day 3
* Today I completed the Coursera course from MongoDB, worked on some use cases and problems. 

### Day 4
* I worked on few problems from Leetcode and practice a lot of problems. 
* I also started writing a Blog post about what I have lerned. I am beginner in content or technical writing so might take some time to come up with the post. I have also decided to write Blog post for every week starting from this week until the end of 66 days of data challange. This will keep me accountable and motivated to come up with different topics to write a Blog. The Blog will be SQL Vs NoSQL their Advantages and Applications and I will be posting this to my Medium account.

### Day 5
* Today again I solved few problems from Leetcode and also on Hackerrank. 
* Blog is halfway through the point now, I know it is talking some time, but this is the 1st time I will be writing so many words and explaining it in simple terms. Let's see how this pans out.  

### Day 6
* Today spent some time on Data structures & Algorithms and @codebasicshub has a really good playlist and he has explained it in simple terms. 

### Day 7
* Today spent some time on DS & Algo problems and was working on #Crackingthecodinginterview, a good book for interviews. Spent some time writing a blog post.

### Day 8
* Today was I spent some time working on #Leetcode problems. Refreshed on some Algorithms
- Big O Notation 
- Search Algorithm
- Sorting Algorithm

### Day 9
* Today I spent some time reading the book Mathematics for #MachineLearning by Marc Peter Deisenroth and brushed off some Linear Algebra Skills - Matrices, Vector Spaces, Linear Mappings & worked on an exercise

### Day 10
* It's 10 days of the #66daysofdata and spent some time analyzing of what I have done in the past 10 days and revied some of the concepts(just skimmed through it) and worked on some exercise related to SQL, DS & Algorithm. 

### Day 11
* Today spent some time doing exercises on Linear Algebra. Worked on Matrix decomposition and Vector Calculus.

### Day 12
* Went through some concepts of #Database Management systems with this great website I found out. 
* Learnt about DBMS Architecture and Data Modeling.

### Day 13
* Worked on some problems on #Hackerrank. Revised some concepts in Probability with this amazing website - Seeing Theory. 

### Day 14
* Revised some concepts on Probability such as Random Value, Discrete and Continous Probabilities. Worked on some exercises from the book -Mathematics for Machine Learning. 

### Day 15
* Started reading the Book Grokking Algorithms and worked on some exercise. 

### Day 16
* Completed 2 chapters of the book Grokking Algorithms and worked on some problems. 

### Day 17
* Started with Python today revised some concepts and solved some problems on #Hackerrank. Also worked on the blog post & will be posting it tomorrow. Had to post this last week but took some as this is my 1st blog

### Day 18 
* Spent some time working OOPs for #Python and got this amazing playlist by @CoreyMschafer. Learnt about Classes and Instances, Class Variables & Inheritance. 

### Day 19
*  Today I was reading some of my newsletters and found a great read! System Design for Recommendations and Search by @eugeneyan 

### Day 20
* Worked on some #Python problems on Hackerrank. Also read some parts of this amazing book Storytelling with Data by Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic

### Day 21
* Read a couple of chapters of this book Storytelling with Data and. Started with the Tableau course for Data Science & Business Analytics on @udemy 

### Day 22
* Today continued some parts of Grokking Algorithms book, learned Recursion, Quicksort, Hash Tables and Breadth-First Search. Worked on some exercise. Also continued with the Tableau course on #udemy
